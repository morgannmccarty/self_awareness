Second-Chance Game - testing a model's ability to change its answer when given feedback.

Features:
- Uses capabilities data to select questions the model got wrong
- Presents each with history showing model already answered incorrectly
- Analyzes how often the model changes its answer
- Can optionally show or redact the model's original answer
